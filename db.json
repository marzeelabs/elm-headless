But will they be able to fulfil the judges’ requirements?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up next it’s the Technical challenge: Mary’s chocolate and beetroot tray bake. The bakers must follow a stripped-back recipe to produce the moist, malty sponge, covered with a cream-cheese icing and decorated with candied beetroot. Who will struggle with the tricky task and who will impress the judges?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the final, Showstopper bake the celebrities are asked to make 3D models of their favourite sporting moments out of biscuits. When it comes to the crunch, who will crumble under the pressure and who will triumph to take home the title of Star Baker?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the celebrity bakers hope to inspire others to get involved in fundraising for Sport Relief, Clare Balding visits Kenya to learn more about the fight against malaria. Viewers will see Clare visit children in a hospital to see how money raise by Sport Relief is helping to make a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can watch The Great Sport Relief Bake Off on BBC One at 8pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t forget you can also Get Baking for Sport Relief.

It's been great having some guests come up and see me though, it'll be so nice having Grimmy and Example with me today. Even though my body is saying ‘please stop’, there is no way I'm giving in. I'm in the zone, even if my legs are not. I think they might still be in Belfast. I'm hanging on by a thread. I really need everyone's help and support to get through the next two days.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his leg muscles seizing up from fatigue and the biting cold, and his feet strapped into his pedals, Greg struggled to keep his balance on the bike and took a fall at the side of the road. Fortunately, he was unharmed and was on his way again in seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His cycle was followed by an indoor swim, when he was joined by singer Example. He then ran through Sheffield city centre to the radio studio where he presented his afternoon show. Luckily he had fellow Radio 1 DJ and presenter Nick Grimshaw to cheer him along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC Radio 1’s Gregathlon for Sport Relief will see Greg attempt to run, swim and cycle a triathlon a day for five consecutive days, across five UK cities. Tomorrow Greg will attempt to complete his final triathlon in Norwich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money raised from the challenge will be spent helping people living unimaginably tough lives, with half of the money raised used to make a difference right here in the UK. The other half is used to transform lives across the world’s poorest communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg needs your support to keep him going as he takes on his Gregathlon. You can sponsor him&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sportrelief.com/sponsorgreg\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by Greg?

He will complete his triathlon with a run past Belfast’s iconic sites, which include the old historic shipyard where the Titanic was built and launched, Stormont Castle and Belfast City Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg will be attempting to complete over 50 miles and with rain forecast, he faces a soggy start to his challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I feel like jelly,” he said, before beginning his swim. “I feel really sick but I'm so excited. To quote The Weeknd: ‘I can't feel my face’ - it's so cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This challenge is going to be difficult, but I've trained really hard for this and I can't wait to get going. Seeing everyone's posts on social tags has been really encouraging, so thank you. I'm going to do the best I can, make it entertaining along the way and hopefully raise lots of cash for Sport Relief.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also received a good luck message from Coldplay’s Chris Martin and The Saturdays’ Mollie King will be cheering him on towards the end of the day as he aims to cross the finish line to make it to his Radio 1 show at 4pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money raised from the Gregathlon will be spent helping people living unimaginably tough lives, with half of the money raised used to make a difference right here in the UK. The other half is used to transform lives across the world’s poorest communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January Greg travelled to Jordan to meet displaced families living in desperate conditions. He visited a nursery within the Azraq refugee camp and saw how Comic Relief funding is helping to give young children back their childhoods. The money raised through Sport Relief could help more children like these get a vital education, and support their families to maintain a crucial sense of community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg needs your support to keep him going as he takes on his Gregathlon. You can sponsor him here: <a class=\"link--inline-red\" href=\"/SponsorGreg\">sportrelief.com/SponsorGreg</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by Greg? Why not take on your own challenge by signing up to the Sainsbury’s Sport Relief Games which take place from Friday 18th to Sunday 20th March. There are thousands of events across the UK with flagship Games in Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow, Sheffield, Norwich and London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find your nearest event at <a class=\"link--inline-red\" href=\"http://www.sportrelief.com\">sportrelief.com</a> and <a class=\"link--inline-red\" href=\"/events\">sign up now!</a></p>\r\n"

He will also be broadcasting his show between 4pm and 7pm every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the course of five days he will criss-cross his way around the nation via Cardiff, Glasgow and Sheffield before storming across the finish line in Norwich on Friday 12th February. Each of the five locations, will be the flagship cities of the Sainsbury’s Sport Relief Games and Greg will be encouraging the public at home to sign up to the event, which takes place from Friday 18th to Sunday 20th March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding its support to Greg is the British Triathlon Federation, the national governing body of triathlon, which includes Triathlon England, TriathlonScotland and Welsh Triathlon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“British Triathlon would like to wish Greg James good luck in his triathlon challenge,” chief executive Jack Buckner, says. “Completing five triathlons in five cities, in five days, is really a huge challenge, not just because of the distances and logistics involved, but also the winter weather. We hope that his swimming, cycling and running exploits help raise a lot of money for Sport Relief.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Triathlete Vicky Holland, a 2014 Commonwealth Games gold and bronze medal winner, who is training for the Rio 2016 Olympics, also sent a message of support. “What a challenge,” she said. “Good luck for the Gregathlon and raising lots of money for Sport Relief. Keep warm, stay safe, make sure you’ve got a good masseuse and keep smiling!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking in the sights with Greg along the way will be fellow presenters of BBC Radio 1, including Nick Grimshaw, and BBC 1Xtra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money raised from The Gregathlon will be spent helping people living unimaginably tough lives, with half of the money raised used to make a difference right here in the UK. The other half is used to transform lives across the world’s poorest communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by Greg? Why not take on your own challenge by signing up to the <a class=\"link--inline-red\" href=\"/events\">Sainsbury’s Sport Relief Games</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"type--centred\"><a class=\"btn btn-red\" href=\"/sponsorgreg\">Sponsor Greg</a></p>\r\n"
